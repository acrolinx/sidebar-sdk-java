	 <p><term>Military time</term> refers to a timekeeping system where the
		hours of the day are numbered 0-24, rather than the 
		<term>standard time</term> system's numbering of 1-12 am and 1-12 pm. 
		<term>Military time</term> is also called the 
		<term>24-hour clock</term>. 
	 </p> 
	 <p><term>Military time</term> is written in the format hh.mm, where h=hours
		and m=minutes. Between 1.00 am and 12.59 pm 
		<term>military time</term> and 
		<term>standard time</term> look very similar. For example, 4.30 am 
		<term>standard time</term> is written as 04.30 in 
		<term>military time</term>. However, after 12.59 pm it becomes slightly
		more difficult to correlate 
		<term>military time</term> and 
		<term>standard time</term>. For example, 6.08 pm 
		<term>standard time</term> is written as 18.08 in 
		<term>military time</term>. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>After 12.59 pm, an easy way to convert 
		<term>military time</term> to 
		<term>standard time</term> is to subtract 12 hours from the 
		<term>military time</term> then add the pm suffix. For example,
		subtracting 12 hours from the 
		<term>military time</term> of 17.45 gives the 
		<term>standard time</term> of 5.45 pm.
	 </p> 
	 <p>Midnight can be expressed as either 00.00 or 24.00 in 
		<term>military time</term>. In practise, 00.00 is used to refer to the
		start of a day, and 24.00 to refer to the end of a day. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>As the name suggests, 
		<term>military time</term> is used by the military to avoid potentially
		dangerous situations that may result if soldiers misunderstand 
		<term>standard time</term>'s am or pm suffix. 
		<term>Military time</term> is used in other industries where time is
		critical, such as computing, aviation, railway timetables and medical
		situations. 
		<term>Military time</term> is the 
		<term>ISO</term> international standard for the notation of time, and is
		used as instead of 
		<term>standard time</term> in many countries, especially in Europe.
