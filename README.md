# Acrolinx Sidebar Java SDK

Acrolinx Sidebar Java SDK

This SDK contains code to build integration for Java FX, Swing or SWT based clients.

## Prerequisites

Please contact Acrolinx SDK support (sdk-support@acrolinx.com) for initial consulting.
We like to schedule a kickoff meeting to answer any questions about your integration project.
After the meeting, we provide you with test server credentials and configuration settings you would need to get started.

## How to Start

This project uses gradle wrapper. Check out the project and navigate into the project folder an run:

```
./gradlew build
```

That will set up the project and dependencies.

## How to Use the Sidebar in Your Integration

Check the [sidebar demo for java on GitHub](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-sidebar-demo-java).

Check the [API Documentation](https://cdn.rawgit.com/acrolinx/sidebar-sdk-java/v1.0.1/docs/index.html).

The sidebar sdk is available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.acrolinx.client%22%20a%3A%22sidebar-sdk%22%20).

## Server Dependency

To use the Acrolinx Sidebar, you need to connect to an Acrolinx server. If you've already received your Acrolinx server address,
youâ€™re good to go. If your company has installed an Acrolinx server, but you don't have an address yet, ask your server administrator first.
