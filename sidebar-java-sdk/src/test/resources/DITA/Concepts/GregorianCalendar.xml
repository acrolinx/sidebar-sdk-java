	 <p>The 
		<term>Gregorian calendar</term> is the calendar used by most societies
		today. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced the calendar in
		1582.
	 </p> 
	 <p>The 
		<term>Gregorian calendar</term> starts from 1 AD, the year that Jesus
		Christ was born, although no firm historical evidence has been uncovered to
		date the birth of Christ with certainty. The AD suffix stands for the Latin
		phrase anno Domini, meaning "in the year of our Lord". The AD suffix is
		sometimes replaced with CE (common era), although the numbering of the years
		does not change if the suffix is changed.
	 </p> 
	 <p>Years prior to the birth of Christ take the suffix BC (before Christ) or
		BCE (before common era), and are numbered backwards from 1 BC.
	 </p> 
	 <p>The 
		<term>Gregorian calendar</term> replaced the 
		<term>Julian calendar 
		</term>used by Christian societies in 1582 AD. The 
		<term>Julian calendar</term> mandated that a year was exactly 365.25 days
		long, rather than the more accurate 365.2425 days long. The slight inaccuracy
		in the 
		<term>Julian calendar</term> caused the calendar to become increasingly
		out of synch with the seasons. To correct the inaccuracy, Pope Gregory deleted
		10 days from 1582, and changed the method that was used to calculate leap
		years.
	 </p> 
	 <p>A leap year is a year that has one extra day added to February, making
		the year 366 days long, rather than the usual 365. The 
		<term>Julian calendar</term> mandated that a leap year should fall on
		every year that is divisible by 4. The 
		<term>Gregorian calendar</term> kept this rule, and further specified
		that a leap year should not occur in years that are divisible by 100, unless
		the year is also divisible by 400. For example, the year 1900 was not a leap
		year, but the year 2000 was a leap year. This slight modification allows the 
		<term>Gregorian calendar 
		</term>to stay aligned with the seasons.
